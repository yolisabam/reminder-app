# Remind.Me

#### *A full MERN stack app that enables users to set up reminders that they receive in the form of a text message*

### About the App

Remind.Me is a MERN stack web app that allows users to set up text reminders for things that matter. It is designed for individuals who have a busy schedule and want to add and additional layer of accountability to their lives.
Text messages have a 98% open rate, while email has only a 20% open rate. We are leveraging this to help people stay on top of their schedules.

### Motivation

We wanted to make an app that will give people more visibility into their hectic schedules. Sending a text reminder days/hours/minutes before the start of the appointment will make a difference and eliminate the risk of missed appointments or having to rush to an appointment that was overlooked.

### Requirements

1. Twilio verified phone number
